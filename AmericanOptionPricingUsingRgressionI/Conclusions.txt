The method simulates geometric Brownian motion paths and uses Longstaff-Schwartz-style regression (polynomial of degree 3) to estimate the continuation value of American options. 
The explicit Euler scheme is used to simulate asset paths under the risk-neutral measure.

Application : Used for pricing American options, which can be exercised at any time before maturity—particularly important in real-world equity options and commodity markets.

Shortcomings:

i. Bias from Regression: The polynomial regression may underfit or overfit in regions with sparse path data.
ii. Computational Cost: Finer time steps (e.g., Δt = 0.001) significantly improve precision but come with a steep increase in computation time.
iii. Only Regression I: This uses a single-pass backward induction, which may not be as accurate as more sophisticated methods (e.g., Regression II or dual methods).
